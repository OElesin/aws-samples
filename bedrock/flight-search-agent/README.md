# Unleashing the Power of Amazon Bedrock on Your Apple Watch and iPhone

## Introduction

This project is inspired by the blog [How to use ChatGPT on your Apple Watch and iPhone](https://medium.com/@FabianMH/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-your-apple-watch-and-iphone-9b6c7f86d7ba) by Fabian Heuwieser. In it, we demonstrate how to connect Amazon Bedrock through a REST API hosted on AWS AppRunner with Apple Shortcuts on iPhone and Apple Watch.

The REST API is created with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and mimics similar endpoints to the OpenAI ChatGPT completions endpoint. The API is not made public and requires an access key to use. If you want to try this out, please drop an email to [elesin.olalekan@gmail.com](mailto:elesin.olalekan@gmail.com)
