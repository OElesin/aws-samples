In the first part of their conversation, they discussed the importance of taking a very granular approach to markets in developing countries, the constraints emerging economies place on business models, and the unique role ecosystems play.

Jonathan Woetzel is a senior partner and director of the McKinsey Global Institute. He joined us from his home in the Los Angeles area. Susan Lund is a partner and leads MGI’s research on global financial markets, trade, labor markets, and the macroeconomic outlook. She joined us from her home in Washington, DC.

Many questions remain. How will communities, businesses, and governments continue to respond to the crisis and what are the range of possible scenarios for decision makers to consider?To offer some perspective on these questions we feature a recent conversation between Sven Smit and Francisco Ortega. Sven is a senior partner at McKinsey, based in Amsterdam and is co-chair of the McKinsey Global Institute. He recently co-authored the article “Safeguarding our lives and our livelihoods,” which forms the basis of this discussion. Francisco is a senior partner based in our Buenos Aires office and serves as Managing Partner for Spanish Latin America. Sven and Francisco spoke via video conference in mid-April. This is an edited version of their conversation.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

Many questions remain. How will communities, businesses, and governments continue to respond to the crisis and what are the range of possible scenarios for decision makers to consider?To offer some perspective on these questions we feature a recent conversation between Sven Smit and Francisco Ortega. Sven is a senior partner at McKinsey, based in Amsterdam and is co-chair of the McKinsey Global Institute. He recently co-authored the article “Safeguarding our lives and our livelihoods,” which forms the basis of this discussion. Francisco is a senior partner based in our Buenos Aires office and serves as Managing Partner for Spanish Latin America. Sven and Francisco spoke via video conference in mid-April. This is an edited version of their conversation.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

In our two previous podcasts we discussed how social dynamics and biases can undermine strategy development and explained the Power Curve of economic profit, which shows how well—or how poorly—the strategies of the world’s largest companies are performing. We also heard about the most important strategic moves companies can make to rise up that Power Curve. Today we will share excerpts from a presentation senior partner Chris Bradley gave at our Global Business Leaders Forum in New York. Chris will take us through some of the practical changes companies can make to their strategic planning process to move their performance into high gear.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

In our two previous podcasts we discussed how social dynamics and biases can undermine strategy development and explained the Power Curve of economic profit, which shows how well—or how poorly—the strategies of the world’s largest companies are performing. We also heard about the most important strategic moves companies can make to rise up that Power Curve. Today we will share excerpts from a presentation senior partner Chris Bradley gave at our Global Business Leaders Forum in New York. Chris will take us through some of the practical changes companies can make to their strategic planning process to move their performance into high gear.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

The conference’s theme was around reinventing the role of the CFO and how digital and analytics are helping drive this reinvention. Kevin’s remarks focused on macro disruptions and the implications for business and society. He sets the stage with a historical perspective on the pace of disruptive technological change using the SS Savannah,one of the first hybrid sailing ships that augmented wind power with a steam engine, to highlight that while change is a constant, the pace of disruptive change has risen dramatically—and will continue to do so.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

The conference’s theme was around reinventing the role of the CFO and how digital and analytics are helping drive this reinvention. Kevin’s remarks focused on macro disruptions and the implications for business and society. He sets the stage with a historical perspective on the pace of disruptive technological change using the SS Savannah,one of the first hybrid sailing ships that augmented wind power with a steam engine, to highlight that while change is a constant, the pace of disruptive change has risen dramatically—and will continue to do so.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

This is why the value of creative and strategic thinkers capable of solving complex problems has never been higher.   Today’s episode features a conversation between Chris Bradley, a senior partner in our Sydney office, and Rob McLean, a Director Emeritus of the firm, a trustee of The Nature Conservancy in Australia and Asia, and director of Australia’s largest philanthropic foundation, the Paul Ramsay Foundation. Rob, along with Charles Conn, is the co-author of a recently published book called Bulletproof Problem Solving: The One Skill That Changes Everything.  Chris and Rob recently met in our Sydney office to talk about Rob’s new book and how a disciplined and comprehensive approach to problem solving can be applied to almost any kind of problem — from personal decisions through to business strategies, and on to some of most complex challenges facing society today.  We hope you enjoy listening to their conversation. </span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

This is why the value of creative and strategic thinkers capable of solving complex problems has never been higher.   Today’s episode features a conversation between Chris Bradley, a senior partner in our Sydney office, and Rob McLean, a Director Emeritus of the firm, a trustee of The Nature Conservancy in Australia and Asia, and director of Australia’s largest philanthropic foundation, the Paul Ramsay Foundation. Rob, along with Charles Conn, is the co-author of a recently published book called Bulletproof Problem Solving: The One Skill That Changes Everything.  Chris and Rob recently met in our Sydney office to talk about Rob’s new book and how a disciplined and comprehensive approach to problem solving can be applied to almost any kind of problem — from personal decisions through to business strategies, and on to some of most complex challenges facing society today.  We hope you enjoy listening to their conversation. </span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

We will hear from entrepreneurs and McKinsey experts about the techniques they use to go to market and scale quickly with limited resources.

In our new Bias Busters series, McKinsey partner Tim Koller and Dan Lovallo, an alumnus of McKinsey’s San Francisco office and professor of business strategy at the University of Sydney, will highlight some of the biases that hold sway in the strategy room. They will also offer effective ways to respond. Our topic for this episode? Taking the “outside view.” Tim, Dan, and host Sean Brown discuss how it’s easier than executives might think to make better forecasts by using a set of reference cases to build the “outside view”. They also discuss how the “outside view” can inform everyday decisions and Dan shares a story about his venture to predict the likelihood of a Hollywood movie succeeding at the domestic box office based on little more than the movie’s promotional poster.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

In our new Bias Busters series, McKinsey partner Tim Koller and Dan Lovallo, an alumnus of McKinsey’s San Francisco office and professor of business strategy at the University of Sydney, will highlight some of the biases that hold sway in the strategy room. They will also offer effective ways to respond. Our topic for this episode? Taking the “outside view.” Tim, Dan, and host Sean Brown discuss how it’s easier than executives might think to make better forecasts by using a set of reference cases to build the “outside view”. They also discuss how the “outside view” can inform everyday decisions and Dan shares a story about his venture to predict the likelihood of a Hollywood movie succeeding at the domestic box office based on little more than the movie’s promotional poster.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

In this episode, Sean Brown is joined by Bruce Simpson, a senior partner in our Toronto office who recently co-authored a chapter in the book, Reimagining Capitalism. Also joining the conversation are Jonathan Godsall and Jack McGinn  from our the New York office.  We discuss how an important part of a successful long-term approach includes a focus on organizational health and culture resulting in higher employee engagement, lower attrition, greater customer loyalty, and trust across stakeholders - as well as superior economic returns. </span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"

In this episode, Sean Brown is joined by Bruce Simpson, a senior partner in our Toronto office who recently co-authored a chapter in the book, Reimagining Capitalism. Also joining the conversation are Jonathan Godsall and Jack McGinn  from our the New York office.  We discuss how an important part of a successful long-term approach includes a focus on organizational health and culture resulting in higher employee engagement, lower attrition, greater customer loyalty, and trust across stakeholders - as well as superior economic returns. </span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Discover our latest insights and join more than 92,000 influential professionals who are part of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>"
